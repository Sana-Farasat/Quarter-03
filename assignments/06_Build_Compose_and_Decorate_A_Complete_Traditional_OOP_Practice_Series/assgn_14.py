# Aggregation
"""
Create a class Department and a class Employee. Use aggregation by having a Department object store a reference to an Employee object that exists independently of it.

# Aggregation vs Composition
"""
Real-Life Analogy:
Aggregation: A university has students. Students can exist outside a university (they may transfer, drop out, etc.).

Composition: A human has a heart. If the human dies, the heart (functionally) dies too.

ðŸ”· Aggregation vs Composition â€” dono "has-a" relationships hain, lekin unmein ek important difference hota hai:
Feature	              Aggregation	                  Composition
Relationship	      Weak "has-a"	                 Strong "has-a"
Lifetime	Part can exist independently	Part cannot exist independently
Ownership	      No strict ownership             	Strict ownership
Example	      Department has an Employee	        House has a Room
